    Please note that this driver is ALPHA software and that it has been
written to gain a better knowledge of the S5933 chip. The code will be used
as a starting point for a different project. The features listed here will
probably never be implemented in this version of the driver.

    For more info on the project see http://pcape1.pi.infn.it/~acister/dev


TODO LIST
=========

    Improve handling of pass-thru regions using device nodes with different
    minor numbers.

    (?) Improve handling of resources by different processes (hack the
    open() function).

    Test the driver with memory mapped operation registers.

    Perform some benchmarks on memory-mapped vs. io-mapped operation
    registers.
